#### The project aims to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

Python was used to preprocess the data and implement the Machine Learning algorithms. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was also implemented. The notebook has detailed description reagrding every step along with important visualizations, and comments in the code when found necessary.

The 3 used traditional Machine Learning algorithms are:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

All of the models had an **accuracy higher than 90%**. However, they had low precision and recall.

The ANN outperformed all of the models and achieved an **an accuracy of 95%**, with a high precision and a relatively high recall (concidering the problem in hand.
